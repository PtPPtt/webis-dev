China Demands USA Give Money to China Because Climate Change – Watts Up With That?

Climate cash
7 years ago

Chinese Minister Xie Zhenhua. By U.S. Department of State – Cropped from File:Secretary Kerry Poses With Chinese National Development Vice Chairman Xie and Special Envoy Stern (12538003013).jpg, original source Secretary Kerry Poses With Chinese National Development Vice Chairman Xie and Special Envoy Stern, Public Domain, Link
Guest essay by Eric Worrall
China is demanding that the USA and other developed countries give China large sums of cash, because the USA owes China and other developing countries for historical US greenhouse gas contributions.
China is also demanding lenient “developing country” accounting oversight over how those climate cash transfers from the USA to China are spent.
China demands developed countries ‘pay their debts’ on climate change
Key sticking point at UN negotiations is how countries should account for their greenhouse gas emissions
China called on rich countries to “pay their debts” on climate change at global talks on Thursday, criticising developed countries for not doing enough to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide finance to help poor countries do the same.
The trenchant intervention by Xie Zhenhua, the minister who leads the Chinese delegation and a veteran of the UN climate negotiations, came as China faced increasing pressure to shift its stance on some of the key rules required to implement the 2015 Paris agreement.
He told a small group of journalists: “Developing countries are not comfortable or happy. [We need to] see if developed countries have honoured their commitments. Still some countries have not started their mitigation efforts, or provided financial support [to poor nations]. We strongly urge them to pay up on their debts.”
…
Developed countries prefer strict standards but developing countries have historically been allowed some leeway, in recognition that their governance structures and capabilities may lag behind.
But the EU and other developed countries are concerned that large rapidly developing economies such as China are not agreeing to adequate transparency in accounting for their emissions.
Xie said the talks were “deadlocked”, but maintained that China should continue to be treated as a developing country, and that developing countries should have flexibility over transparency rules.
…

The situation is even more ridiculous when you consider that the US Federal Government is in severe deficit, they borrow billions of dollars every year. Much of that borrowed cash comes from China.
So the Chinese negotiator Xie Zhenhua’s position amounts to a demand that the USA borrow money from China, gift the principle back to China, then repay the loan that they just gifted to China.
My question – would President Obama have agreed the Chinese demand?

While this argument is normally crafted around historical emissions of developed countries, it sidesteps the fact that all these virtue signalling Americans and Europeans are complicit in the everyday shifting of CURRENT emissions to China as a direct byproduct of NIMBY attitudes in policy, regulations, lawsuits, and consumer purchasing. The funds transfer is already taking place along with this massive emissions transfer in current activities.

“Yes we can” lead to nothing. MAGA, on the other hand is an actual policy.
But as Donald Trump turns up the heat on Sino-US trade relations and China scrambles for ways to offset the effects, it becomes apparent that this Republican fiscal reform was designed to build a fortress around US growth, from which an attack could be launched. This was cunning, and may eventually prove ingenious.
China’s biggest miscalculation was to underestimate Trump. Through waging an ideological war against China via the proxy of trade imbalances, he saw clearer than anyone the path along which this war would unfold, and the inevitable casualties that the US would also have to suffer along the way.
I think their response may not be nuanced.
For instance, they have turned up the heat on Canada over the arrest of a Chinese executive for likely extradition to the US.
That’s unfortunate.
I think they may need all the friends they can get.

This is a bogus demand. The data says CO2 has little if any effect on climate. Temperature is now about what it was in 2002. CO2 has increased since 2002 by 40% of the increase 1800 to 2002.
By similarity, none of the other ghg (except water vapor) have any significant effect on climate either.

The correct response of environmentalists to China’s GHG emissions is to totally stop buying Chinese goods and services, including wind and solar equipment.
The GHG emissions increases in China from such purchases are not included in the GHG reductions calculated for these instillations in the US.
Therefore, I would propose that there is no net global GHG reduction for the billions spent on Chinese equipment.
We should then propose to China that what we have given them in trade value for GHG “mitigation” devices, solar panels and wind turbines, constitutes a transfer of wealth as these devices essentially have not real value in the US therefore the funds were a gift to China for essentially nothing in return.
Twisted logic, but no worse than the same type of logic used by proponents of wind and solar.

Your ‘twisted logic’ is unfortunately close to being right on.
Left out of ALL the analysis of installing stupid solar and stupid wind in the West
is the resulting transfer of western currency to China for the equipment.
How much of the ‘price of solar dropping fast’ is due to sourcing from China?
Pretty much all I would say.
Further, what happens to that western currency?
Well part of it goes to making loans to African countries that want to build a cheap coal fired electric plant, the loan courtesy of China with the stipulation that Chinese equipment and labor be used in the installation.
And really, it is just a little fishy that the old Chinese idea that you are responsible for 7 generations of your ancestors debts is pretty much the same as ‘climate debt’.
Screw it I say.

You’re missing the wider aim Marlene, they don’t expect to get any money, they know they’ll never get that.
They only want to make this a global polarization focus point, of ‘Rich’ against ‘Poor’, Socialists (Commie-light) against Capitalism (see IPCC related comfort to the enemy), with Beijing amping the divisions with nonsense and the ‘championing’ socialism with Chinese characteristics (Communism), against the evils and greed of Capitalism, with USA characteristics.
I see this as one of the opening shots in a wider global polarization effort to push communism on to the rest of the world (to save them with debt) in order to hinder Western influence and access.
It’s got absolutely nothing to do with AGW.

Obama gave $1 billion in two tranches to the Green Climate Fund.
This was done without Congressional Appropriation of such funds and is technically a violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act.
He got around that by saying it was from excess State Department funds.
At the time, I suggested we cut the State Department budget if they had cash laying around.

Claim is that it was seized, impounded, or something, but was their money. Could have been money they paid for US planes that were not delivered. Something about a disposed Shah and a revolution. Should be easy to find the specifics of the money.

Tom:
I might have something of an answer for you. Check out the following document penned by Julia Frifield, Assistant Secretary of Legal Affairs, to Mike Pompeo, then Kansas Congressman. Pompeo has written to the Obama administration asking for answers regarding from where the money came.
http://www.thestupidithurts.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Ransom-Iran-Kerry-Reply.pdf
Of particular note (at least in my view), is the admission by Ms. Frifield (see p. 3, par. 3) that at the time the United States had pending unresolved counterclaims against Iran that could have been settled from the very fund the Obama administration used to fund the aforementioned payments.
Meaning, of course, that the claim that “it was their money” by those who supported the payments was untrue, at least in the sense that because there were also unresolved claims by the U.S. pending against Iran, those claims could’ve been settled first before these payments were made, thereby adjusting the amount due.
Naturally (or so it seems to me), that wasn’t the intent at all. The intent was to give $1.7B to a terrorist nation for whatever nefarious purpose (I’m not sure anything but speculation can be asserted with confidence) the then sitting President thought it wise.

Who is surprised? You set up a stupid wrong system with no basis in reality and you are surprised when those who live permanently in left field see an opportunity in your pathetic virtue signalling? China can go sling their hook as far as I am concered but I want those responsible in the Obama admin in the dock pretty damned quick!

Suppose that the objective were to INCREASE the emissions of CO2, how would you achieve that? Simple, just give money to developing countries so that their carbon footprint per person can rise to the levels enjoyed in the developed countries.
This is not even snake-oil for a genuine ailment, it is just wealth transfer, and politics by proxy.

When shrimps learn to whistle. When pigs learn to fly. But, what can it hurt them to demand? As in golf, “Never up, never in.” Roll the ball, it just might find the hole.

No greater evidence that China is a communist country. They want to redistribute our earnings to them because they want it and don’t want to have to work for it themselves.
Of Course!

We should definitely pay China for CO2 emissions related deaths.
As long as they agree for killing 100,000 North Americans per year with fentanyl.
They should be expecting their first check on the 5th of Hellfreezing Over in 20,000,000 CE.

We are not in severe deficit we are in severe DEBT.
Severe Deficit is planning to overspend by a quarter billion.
Severe Debt is already being 20 Trillion Dollars in DEBT with another 70 TRillion in Unfunded non-discretionary spending coming due with Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid in the course of the next 20 years
Severe Delusion is continuing to overspend (deficit) when we are obligated to pay back an amount of money (debt) that we won’t be able to retire in 5 generations if we stop discretionary spending today.

if you really want to make Yourself depressed, here is the American
debt clock in real time

Your country would be foolish in the extreme to pay out vast sums of money it doesn’t have in order to mend something that probably isn’t even broken.

The estimation of future debt is in part dependent on price.
The question then is whether price is commensurate with cost and value.
There is evidence that inflated costs are first-order forcings of decadal resets (e.g. recessions).
Social Security is a public smoothing function that is contributory and has a fixed outlay, and can be reasonably forecast, therefore managed.
Medicare is contributory, but because of native dysfunctional orientations and behaviors, will be underfunded.
Medicaid is a non-contributory, wholly public institution, and will suffer the same problems as Medicare, but with different causes.
Then there are the private smoothing functions (e.g. family, charity, insurance).
Arbitrage is a class of smoothing function.
Chinese labor and environmental practices have subsidized global inflation and expectation.
Technological development is another smoothing function, which we have developed
a habit of outsourcing for short-term returns.

Beijing is going broke and the Communists leaders got into the good life.
Stock positions etc.
Their stock market is in serious decline and there was a headline a couple of weeks ago.
About the apartment vacancy rate up to 22%—which means 50 million empty apartments.

Every day, I wake up thinking, I can’t possibly be more outraged than the day before.
Every day I’m wrong.
I don’t think I’ve ever looked forward to a New Year less in my life.

“My question – would President Obama have agreed [to] the Chinese demand?”
You know he would. He embezzled $1 billion of taxpayer money to feed the Green Climate Fund (at least $500 million of which was originally appropriated by congress to go towards fighting deadly diseases such as the Zika virus). He sent pallets of cash to Iran. He would definitely have no problem giving away taxpayer money to China.

Ahhhh, this is grand! It’s complete stupidity like this that will help dismantle the madness. I sure hope the MSM actually plays this up so the taxpayer can see the tomfoolery that is going on. The Yellow Jackets won’t be far behind if the answer isn’t a firm no.
