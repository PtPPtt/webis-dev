As the world's second-largest economy and top exporter, China's economic performance has far-reaching implications for international trade, financial markets, and geopolitical dynamics.\nRecent developments in China's economy include efforts to balance growth with financial stability amidst ongoing trade tensions with the United States and other Western nations. The People's Bank of China has implemented targeted monetary policies to support key sectors while managing debt levels. Meanwhile, China's tech sector faces increased regulatory scrutiny, impacting giants like Alibaba and Tencent, as the government aims to curb monopolistic practices and enhance data security.\nThe Chinese economy's transition towards a consumption-driven model continues to shape social dynamics, with rising middle-class consumption patterns influencing global markets. Initiatives like the \"Common Prosperity\" campaign aim to address income inequality and promote sustainable growth. Additionally, China's ambitious Belt and Road Initiative continues to expand its economic influence across Asia, Africa, and Europe, despite facing challenges and criticisms.\nHistorically, China's economic reforms initiated by Deng Xiaoping in 1978 set the stage for decades of rapid growth, transforming the country from a primarily agrarian society to an industrial and technological powerhouse. The current economic landscape reflects this legacy, as China navigates the complexities of maintaining growth while addressing structural challenges such as an ageing population and environmental concerns.\nStaying informed about China's economy is crucial for understanding global economic trends and making informed decisions. Our NewsNow feed provides real-time updates from trusted sources, offering comprehensive coverage of China's economic indicators, policy shifts, and market movements, ensuring readers have access to the latest developments shaping the world's most populous nation and its economic future.",

China’s exports rose 5.5% for the whole of last year to $3.77 trillion, customs data showed, as Chinese automakers and other manufacturers expanded into markets across the globe. Imports flatlined at $2.58 trillion. The 2024 trade surplus was over $992 billion.\nIn December, China’s exports climbed 6.6% from the year before in dollar terms, better than economists’ estimates and higher than November’s 5.9% year-on-year increase. Imports in December were up 5.7% year-on-year, compared to November’s 1.9%.\nAerial view of new cars waiting for shipment at a port in Shanghai on Wednesday. (Chinatopix Via AP)\nChina’s trade surplus surpassed the $1 trillion mark for the first time in November, when the trade surplus reached $1.08 trillion in the first 11 months of last year.Economists expect exports will continue to support China’s economy this year, despite trade friction and geopolitical tensions.“We continue to expect exports to act as a big growth driver in 2026,” said Jacqueline Rong, chief China economist at BNP Paribas.\nRelated Stories\nTrump’s protectionist trade policies allow China to swoop in\n6 MIN READ\nAnalysis: Canada’s leader leaves China pronouncing success, but Trump lurks in the background\n5 MIN READ\nChinese EVs are making inroads in North America. That worries industry experts\n5 MIN READ\nWhile China’s exports to the U.S. fell sharply after Trump returned to office and escalated his trade war with the world’s second-largest economy, that decline has been largely offset by shipments to other markets in South America, Southeast Asia, Africa and Europe.\nStay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.\nFollow on\nFor the whole of 2025, China’s exports to the U.S. fell 20%. In contrast, exports to Africa surged 26%. Those to Southeast Asian countries jumped 13%; to the European Union 8%, and to Latin America, 7%.\nStrong global demand for computer chips and other devices and the materials needed to make them were among categories that supported China’s exports, analysts said.Car exports also grew last year. Auto exports surged 21% in 2025 to more than 7 million units, driven by electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, an industry group, on Wednesday.\nMechanical and electrical items were the largest export category last year, rising 8.4% from a year earlier, customs data showed. China also exported more grain and fertilizer, while exports of furniture, clothing, shoes and other labor intensive products fell.\nAerial view of a container terminal in Nanjing in eastern China’s Jiangsu province, Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2026. (Chinatopix Via AP)\nStrong exports have helped keep China’s economy growing at an annual rate close to its official target of about 5%. That has triggered alarm in countries that fear a flood of cheap imports is damaging local industries.China faces a “severe and complex” external trade environment in 2026, Wang Jun, vice minister of China’s customs administration, told reporters in Beijing. But he said China’s “foreign trade fundamentals remain solid.”\n“Even if exports sustain neutral or positive growth this year, more of China’s growth drivers will need to come from domestic demand,” wrote HSBC economists Erin Xin and Taylor Wang in a note on Wednesday.\nAn aerial view of a container terminal in Nanjing in eastern China’s Jiangsu province on Wednesday. (Chinatopix Via AP)\nThe head of the International Monetary Fund last month called for China to fix its economic imbalances and speed up its shift from reliance on exports by boosting domestic consumption and investment.A prolonged property downturn in China after the authorities cracked down on excessive borrowing, triggering defaults by many developers, is still weighing on consumer confidence and domestic demand.China’s leaders have made increasing spending by consumers and businesses a focus of economic policy, but actions taken so far have had a limited impact. That included government trade-in subsidies over the past months that encouraged consumers to buy newer, more energy efficient items, such as home appliances and vehicles.“We expect domestic demand growth to stay tepid,” said Rong of BNP Paribas. “In fact, the policy boost to domestic demand looks weaker than last year -- in particular the fiscal subsidy program for consumer goods.”In the case of autos, domestic passenger car sales rose 6% in 2025, according to industry figures, but they fell back toward the end of the year as subsidies were scaled back or phased out in some areas.Gary Ng, a senior economist at French investment bank Natixis, forecasts that China’s exports will grow about 3% in 2026, less than the 5.5% growth in 2025. With slow import growth, he expects China’s trade surplus to remain above $1 trillion this year.\nCHAN HO-HIM\nChan covers China business, economy and finance for The Associated Press, reporting on key sectors from technology to trade.
