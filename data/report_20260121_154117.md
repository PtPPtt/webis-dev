Published: 04 Jun 2024
The CEOs of AMD, Intel, Nvidia and Qualcomm all delivered keynotes during Computex conference in Taiwan this week to share significant chip advancements as the companies aim to turn every device into an AI device.
The vendors pushed "AI everywhere" agendas during the computing conference, touting generative AI as the technology that will make companies more efficient and "improve lives."
"AI is our number one priority, and we are at the beginning of an incredibly exciting time for the industry as AI transforms virtually every business, improves our quality of life, and reshapes every part of the computing market," AMD CEO Lisa Su said in her opening keynote, which was live streamed.
AI is also critical to these chip makers' bottom lines. Nvidia leads the AI chip market with dramatic stock price surges to prove it, but there is room for the other chip makers to stake a claim. Revenue from AI chips globally is expected to reach $71 billion this year, up 33% from 2023, according to a recent forecast from Gartner.
While the chip makers all touted their incredibly fast, power-efficient processors that can deliver GenAI workloads from any device, most enterprises are years away from needing hardware that's purpose-built for GenAI, particularly laptops and PCs.
"Since organizations are in three-to-five-year refresh cycles, we're probably 18 to 24 months away from seeing any critical mass of these in the workforce," said Gabe Knuth, an analyst at TechTarget's Enterprise Strategy Group. "At that point, I suspect we'll also begin to see what uses for local AI hardware stick, and the real momentum will start to build toward a moment when all PCs will have some AI capabilities in three to five years."
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers his keynote at Computex 2024.
NPUs, TOPS key to AI PC performance
During Su's keynote, she introduced AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series mobile processors and AMD Ryzen 9000 Series processors for laptops and PCs. She also emphasized the importance of neural processing units (NPUs) to run AI workloads efficiently. That includes tasks such as real time translation, content creation, and customized digital assistants to help with decision making, Su said.
NPUs help devices run longer, quieter and cooler as AI tasks run continually in the background, according to Gartner.
Pavan Davuluri, Microsoft vice president of Windows devices, joined Su on the Computex keynote stage to explain the importance of specialized chips with built-in NPUs for Copilot+ PCs, the tech giant's AI-focused PCs.
"On-device AI means faster response time, better privacy, lower costs. But that means running models with billions of parameters in them on PC hardware," Davuluri said.
"Compared to traditional PCs of just a few years ago, we are talking 20 times the performance and up to 100 times the efficiency [required] for AI workloads," he continued. "To make that possible, every CoPilot+ PC needs an NPU of at least 40 TOPS [trillions of operations per second]."
Microsoft launched its CoPilot+ PCs last month with Qualcomm as its first chip provider.
Earlier this week at Computex, Qualcomm president and CEO Cristiano Amon announced the company's entry into the AI PC market with Snapdragon X chips. Qualcomm claims Snapdragon X series systems offer days-long battery life at 45 TOPS AI performance.
"One thing that will be different about this new PC -- unlike in the past, your Windows PC will get better over time," Amon said during his keynote.
Like AMD, Qualcomm touted the NPU as the key to performance. AI workloads are offloaded from the CPU and GPU to the NPU, providing significant performance enhancement and power savings.
Meanwhile, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger introduced the new Lunar Lake processors for Copilot+ PCs during Computex but emphasized the benefits of x86 CPUs and GPUs combined with NPUs.
"Since there's been some talk about this other X Elite chip and its superiority to the X86 [chips], I just want to put that to bed right now. Ain't true," Gelsinger said in his keynote, referring to Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite.
Gelsinger cited significant power and efficiency gains in Lunar Lake processors, which will power more than 80 models of CoPilot+ PCs from 20 equipment suppliers beginning in the third quarter of 2024. Lunar Lake delivers 48 NPU TOPS and up to four times the AI compute power over the previous generation to improve generative AI workloads.
With the introduction of AMD's own NPU delivering 50 TOPS and Intel's 48 compared to Qualcomm's 45, the AI PC arms race is rapidly advancing, Knuth said.
"The TOPS war has begun," he added.
As for Nvidia, at the AI chip giant at Computex launched new AI PCs built on its RTX platform, and an RTX AI Toolkit, a collection of free tools and SDKs that Windows app developers can use to customize and deploy AI models for Windows applications. The RTX platform targets gamers and content creators.
It's early days for AI PCs but within the next two to three years, they will make up 65%-75% of the PC market and even higher in the enterprise, said Jack Gold, founder and analyst at J Gold Associates.
"I expect Intel to hold the majority of enterprise market share, followed by AMD, with Qualcomm being more popular in the high-end consumer and SMB space but still a minority player," Gold said.
Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger on stage at Computex 2024 introducing Lunar Lake chips.
AI chips, beyond PCs
Beyond endpoint devices, Nvidia, AMD and Intel all shared visions of transforming data centers.
Nvidia launched its new Blackwell architecture systems, which include Grace CPUs, and Nivida networking and infrastructure that companies will use to build "AI factories" and data centers to support future GenAI breakthroughs.
Intel launched Xeon 6 chips in two form factors: the Performance Core for resource intensive AI applications and the Efficient Core that's designed for power efficiency in data centers.
AMD introduced its AI and adaptive computing technology, AMD Versal AI Edge Series Gen 2, available now. It combines field programmable gate array logic for real-time preprocessing, AI Engines powered by XDNA dataflow architecture technology for AI inference and embedded CPUs for edge AI.
The new AMD Instinct MI325X server accelerator with be available in Q4 2024. The chip vendor also previewed its fifth generation EPYC brand of multi-core server processors, codenamed Turin, expected to launch in the second half of this year.
With plenty of AI hardware options to choose from, IT buying decisions might come down to performance per dollar or performance per watt. That's because of the "extreme power required to run the high-end chips like [Nvidia's] B200 is problematic from a power availability and cost perspective," Gold said.
"Inference workloads will happily run on more generic CPUs with some AI acceleration as needed. And since ultimately inference workloads will be the major bulk of AI processing, that gives Intel and AMD some advantages, as Nvidia really doesn't have a competitive CPU offering," Gold said. " Diversity in AI-based processing will be key to expansion in the market for AI workloads over the next two to three years."

AMD reveals next-generation AI chips with OpenAI CEO Sam AltmanSkip NavigationMarketsBusinessInvestingTechPoliticsVideoWatchlistInvesting ClubPROLivestreamMenuKey PointsAMD on Thursday unveiled new details about its next-generation AI chips, the Instinct MI400 series, that will ship next year. CEO Lisa Su unveiled the chips at a launch event in San Jose, California.The chips will be able to be used as part of a "rack-scale" system, AMD said. That's important for customers that want "hyperscale" clusters of AI computers that can span entire data centers.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman appeared on stage on with Su and said his company would use the AMD chips. "It's gonna be an amazing thing," Altman said.In this articleAMDFollow your favorite stocksCREATE FREE ACCOUNTLisa Su, CEO of Advanced Micro Devices, testifies during the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee hearing titled "Winning the AI Race: Strengthening U.S. Capabilities in Computing and Innovation," in Hart building on Thursday, May 8, 2025. Tom Williams | CQ-Roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesAdvanced Micro Devices on Thursday unveiled new details about its next-generation AI chips, the Instinct MI400 series, that will ship next year.The MI400 chips will be able to be assembled into a full server rack called Helios, AMD said, which will enable thousands of the chips to be tied together in a way that they can be used as one "rack-scale" system."For the first time, we architected every part of the rack as a unified system," AMD CEO Lisa Su said at a launch event in San Jose, California, on Thursday.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman appeared on stage on with Su and said his company would use the AMD chips."When you first started telling me about the specs, I was like, there's no way, that just sounds totally crazy," Altman said. "It's gonna be an amazing thing."AMD's rack-scale setup will make the chips look to a user like one system, which is important for most artificial intelligence customers like cloud providers and companies that develop large language models. Those customers want "hyperscale" clusters of AI computers that can span entire data centers and use massive amounts of power."Think of Helios as really a rack that functions like a single, massive compute engine," said Su, comparing it against Nvidia's Vera Rubin racks, which are expected to be released next year.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman poses during the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Summit, at the Grand Palais, in Paris, on February 11, 2025. Joel Saget | Afp | Getty ImagesAMD's rack-scale technology also enables its latest chips to compete with Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which already come in configurations with 72 graphics-processing units stitched together. Nvidia is AMD's primary and only rival in big data center GPUs for developing and deploying AI applications.OpenAI — a notable Nvidia customer — has been giving AMD feedback on its MI400 roadmap, the chip company said. With the MI400 chips and this year's MI355X chips, AMD is planning to compete against rival Nvidia on price, with a company executive telling reporters on Wednesday that the chips will cost less to operate thanks to lower power consumption, and that AMD is undercutting Nvidia with "aggressive" prices.So far, Nvidia has dominated the market for data center GPUs, partially because it was the first company to develop the kind of software needed for AI developers to take advantage of chips originally designed to display graphics for 3D games. Over the past decade, before the AI boom, AMD focused on competing against Intel in server CPUs.Su said that AMD's MI355X can outperform Nvidia's Blackwell chips, despite Nvidia using its "proprietary" CUDA software."It says that we have really strong hardware, which we always knew, but it also shows that the open software frameworks have made tremendous progress," Su said.AMD shares are flat so far in 2025, signaling that Wall Street doesn't yet see it as a major threat to Nvidia's dominance.AMDCourtesy: AMDAndrew Dieckmann, AMD's general manger for data center GPUs, said Wednesday that AMD's AI chips would cost less to operate and less to acquire."Across the board, there is a meaningful cost of acquisition delta that we then layer on our performance competitive advantage on top of, so significant double-digit percentage savings," Dieckmann said.Over the next few years, big cloud companies and countries alike are poised to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to build new data center clusters around GPUs in order to accelerate the development of cutting-edge AI models. That includes $300 billion this year alone in planned capital expenditures from megacap technology companies.AMD is expecting the total market for AI chips to exceed $500 billion by 2028, although it hasn't said how much of that market it can claim — Nvidia has over 90% of the market currently, according to analyst estimates.Both companies have committed to releasing new AI chips on an annual basis, as opposed to a biannual basis, emphasizing how fierce competition has become and how important bleeding-edge AI chip technology is for companies like Microsoft, Oracle and Amazon.AMD has bought or invested in 25 AI companies in the past year, Su said, including the purchase of ZT Systems earlier this year, a server maker that developed the technology AMD needed to build its rack-sized systems."These AI systems are getting super complicated, and full-stack solutions are really critical," Su said.What AMD is selling nowCurrently, the most advanced AMD AI chip being installed from cloud providers is its Instinct MI355X, which the company said started shipping in production last month. AMD said that it would be available for rent from cloud providers starting in the third quarter.Companies building large data center clusters for AI want alternatives to Nvidia, not only to keep costs down and provide flexibility, but also to fill a growing need for "inference," or the computing power needed for actually deploying a chatbot or generative AI application, which can use much more processing power than traditional server applications."What has really changed is the demand for inference has grown significantly," Su said.AMD officials said Thursday that they believe their new chips are superior for inference to Nvidia's. That's because AMD's chips are equipped with more high-speed memory, which allows bigger AI models to run on a single GPU.The MI355X has seven times the amount of computing power as its predecessor, AMD said. Those chips will be able to compete with Nvidia's B100 and B200 chips, which have been shipping since late last year.AMD said that its Instinct chips have been adopted by seven of the 10 largest AI customers, including OpenAI, Tesla, xAI, and Cohere.Oracle plans to offer clusters with over 131,000 MI355X chips to its customers, AMD said.Officials from Meta said Thursday that they were using clusters of AMD's CPUs and GPUs to run inference for its Llama model, and that it plans to buy AMD's next-generation servers.A Microsoft representative said that it uses AMD chips to serve its Copilot AI features.Competing on priceAMD declined to say how much its chips cost — it doesn't sell chips by themselves, and end-users usually buy them through a hardware company like Dell or Super Micro Computer — but the company is planning for the MI400 chips to compete on price.The Santa Clara company is pairing its GPUs alongside its CPUs and networking chips from its 2022 acquisition of Pensando to build its Helios racks. That means greater adoption of its AI chips should also benefit the rest of AMD's business. It's also using an open-source networking technology to closely integrate its rack systems, called UALink, versus Nvidia's proprietary NVLink.AMD claims its MI355X can deliver 40% more tokens — a measure of AI output — per dollar than Nvidia's chips because its chips use less power than its rival's.Data center GPUs can cost tens of thousands of dollars per chip, and cloud companies usually buy them in large quantities.AMD's AI chip business is still much smaller than Nvidia's. It said it had $5 billion in AI sales in its fiscal 2024, but JP Morgan analysts are expecting 60% growth in the category this year.WATCH: AMD CEO Lisa Su: Chip export controls are a headwind but we still see growth opportunitywatch nowVIDEO6:0306:03AMD CEO Lisa Su: Chip export controls are a headwind but we still see growth opportunitySquawk on the StreetCNBC Disruptor 50 2026: Nominate a company to be included on the list of the most innovative startupsCNBC.com staff2025 CNBC Disruptor 50: See the full list of companies leading new era of AI breakthroughs and richesCNBC.com staffOpenAI in talks with Amazon about investment that could exceed $10 billionAshley CapootRead More
