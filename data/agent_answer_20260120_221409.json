By U.S. Department of State – Cropped from File:Secretary Kerry Poses With Chinese National Development Vice Chairman Xie and Special Envoy Stern (12538003013).jpg, original source Secretary Kerry Poses With Chinese National Development Vice Chairman Xie and Special Envoy Stern, Public Domain, Link\nGuest essay by Eric Worrall\nChina is demanding that the USA and other developed countries give China large sums of cash, because the USA owes China and other developing countries for historical US greenhouse gas contributions.\nChina is also demanding lenient “developing country” accounting oversight over how those climate cash transfers from the USA to China are spent.\nChina demands developed countries ‘pay their debts’ on climate change\nKey sticking point at UN negotiations is how countries should account for their greenhouse gas emissions\nChina called on rich countries to “pay their debts” on climate change at global talks on Thursday, criticising developed countries for not doing enough to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide finance to help poor countries do the same.\nThe trenchant intervention by Xie Zhenhua, the minister who leads the Chinese delegation and a veteran of the UN climate negotiations, came as China faced increasing pressure to shift its stance on some of the key rules required to implement the 2015 Paris agreement.\nHe told a small group of journalists: “Developing countries are not comfortable or happy. [We need to] see if developed countries have honoured their commitments. Still some countries have not started their mitigation efforts, or provided financial support [to poor nations]. We strongly urge them to pay up on their debts.”\n…\nDeveloped countries prefer strict standards but developing countries have historically been allowed some leeway, in recognition that their governance structures and capabilities may lag behind.\nBut the EU and other developed countries are concerned that large rapidly developing economies such as China are not agreeing to adequate transparency in accounting for their emissions.\nXie said the talks were “deadlocked”, but maintained that China should continue to be treated as a developing country, and that developing countries should have flexibility over transparency rules.\n…\nRead more: https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/dec/13/china-demands-developed-countries-pay-their-debts-on-climate-change\nThe situation is even more ridiculous when you consider that the US Federal Government is in severe deficit, they borrow billions of dollars every year. Much of that borrowed cash comes from China.\nSo the Chinese negotiator Xie Zhenhua’s position amounts to a demand that the USA borrow money from China, gift the principle back to China, then repay the loan that they just gifted to China.\nMy question – would President Obama have agreed the Chinese demand?\n0\n0\nvotes\nArticle Rating\nShare this:\nPrint (Opens in new window)\nPrint\nEmail a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\nEmail\nPostMore\nShare on GETTR (Opens in new window)\nGETTR\nTweet\nShare on Telegram (Opens in new window)\nTelegram\nLike this:Like Loading...\nDiscover more from Watts Up With That?\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\nType your email…\nSubscribe\n137 Comments\nInline Feedbacks\nView all comments\nTaphonomic\nDecember 14, 2018 10:10 am\nNothing like the world’s largest emitter of CO2 demanding money to continue increasing their CO2 emissions because, climate change.\n0\nLatitude\nReply to\nTaphonomic\nDecember 14, 2018 12:14 pm\n….and less transparency in reporting\nI didn’t think you could get less transparency in China’s reporting\n0\nBryan A\nReply to\nLatitude\nDecember 14, 2018 10:18 pm\nSimple solution…USA prints up a boatload of Yuan\nand pays China with it\n0\nMenicholas\nReply to\nTaphonomic\nDecember 14, 2018 4:13 pm\nExactly!\nWhat debt is it and what for?\nFor past emissions?\nThey currently emit for more than we ever did, ever, and their emissions are climbing steeply.\nThis position statement from China is warmista jackassery at it’s finest.\nSelf-serving and bereft of facts.\n0\nBryan A\nReply to\nMenicholas\nDecember 14, 2018 10:23 pm\nHow has Chinese rice yields reacted to the increased CO2 from USAs fossil fuel usage.

MAGA, on the other hand is an actual policy.\nBut as Donald Trump turns up the heat on Sino-US trade relations and China scrambles for ways to offset the effects, it becomes apparent that this Republican fiscal reform was designed to build a fortress around US growth, from which an attack could be launched. This was cunning, and may eventually prove ingenious.\nChina’s biggest miscalculation was to underestimate Trump. Through waging an ideological war against China via the proxy of trade imbalances, he saw clearer than anyone the path along which this war would unfold, and the inevitable casualties that the US would also have to suffer along the way.\nI think their response may not be nuanced.\nFor instance, they have turned up the heat on Canada over the arrest of a Chinese executive for likely extradition to the US.\nThat’s unfortunate.\nI think they may need all the friends they can get.\n0\ncommieBob\nReply to\ncommieBob\nDecember 14, 2018 1:33 pm\n‘lead’ should be ‘led’\n0\nDoug\nReply to\ncommieBob\nDecember 14, 2018 1:59 pm\nNo worries, a few spelling errors are actually appropriate when discussing Trump:\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-perfect-cover-letter-for-aspiring-white-house-chiefs-of-staff/2018/12/10/7ad735f0-fcbe-11e8-ad40-cdfd0e0dd65a_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.2e78bd0864a0\n0\nLatitude\nReply to\nResourceGuy\nDecember 14, 2018 12:16 pm\nWhile this argument is normally crafted around….per capita\nThe loons that say that have no idea how many people are in this world\n0\nJ Mac\nReply to\nResourceGuy\nDecember 14, 2018 12:22 pm\nWhile this argument is normally crafted around historical emissions of developed countries, it sidesteps the fact that CO2 is not pollution!\nCO2 is the gas all humans exhale at 20,000ppmv with every breath.\nCO2 is the gas essential for all plant growth on the planet.\nFocus on those undeniable paramount facts and all else becomes laughably trivial.\n0\nMenicholas\nReply to\nJ Mac\nDecember 14, 2018 4:15 pm\n+\n0\nResourceGuy\nDecember 14, 2018 10:16 am\nAny new carbon tax should be on imports from China.\n0\nFred Middleton\nReply to\nResourceGuy\nDecember 14, 2018 10:37 am\nSolar panels\n0\nLatitude\nReply to\nResourceGuy\nDecember 14, 2018 1:18 pm\nMade in China…….\n/revision/latest?cb=20140704100635\n0\nDan Pangburn\nDecember 14, 2018 10:16 am\nThis is a bogus demand.

Check out the following document penned by Julia Frifield, Assistant Secretary of Legal Affairs, to Mike Pompeo, then Kansas Congressman. Pompeo has written to the Obama administration asking for answers regarding from where the money came.\nhttp://www.thestupidithurts.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Ransom-Iran-Kerry-Reply.pdf\nOf particular note (at least in my view), is the admission by Ms. Frifield (see p. 3, par. 3) that at the time the United States had pending unresolved counterclaims against Iran that could have been settled from the very fund the Obama administration used to fund the aforementioned payments.\nMeaning, of course, that the claim that “it was their money” by those who supported the payments was untrue, at least in the sense that because there were also unresolved claims by the U.S. pending against Iran, those claims could’ve been settled first before these payments were made, thereby adjusting the amount due.\nNaturally (or so it seems to me), that wasn’t the intent at all. The intent was to give $1.7B to a terrorist nation for whatever nefarious purpose (I’m not sure anything but speculation can be asserted with confidence) the then sitting President thought it wise.\n0\nGary Ashe\nReply to\nsycomputing\nDecember 15, 2018 11:05 am\n”My question – would President Obama have agreed the Chinese demand?\nYou may have meant to say, “have agreed to” and it seems to me there’s every reason to believe that pallets of cash could have suddenly appeared on the tarmac of some Chinese airport in the deep night had President Obama been afforded the opportunity to participate.”\nIt is\n”dead of night”..\n0\nTinyCO2\nDecember 14, 2018 10:45 am\nIt’s not the US’s fault that China chose to run down an ecnomic black hole called communism.

He embezzled $1 billion of taxpayer money to feed the Green Climate Fund (at least $500 million of which was originally appropriated by congress to go towards fighting deadly diseases such as the Zika virus).
